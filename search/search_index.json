Dr. Hiroyuki Sumi, working at the University of Chicago\u2019s School of Medicine, was searching for what no laboratory had yet achieved: an orally administered thrombolytic agent that was safe and capable of dissolving blood clots from within.</p> <p>For months, he tested foods one by one \u2014 173 in total.

In his paper, he wrote that the enzyme displayed \u201ca potency that no other natural enzyme tested could match.\u201d</p> <p>Nattokinase is a serine protease composed of 275 amino acids with a molecular weight of 27.7 kilodaltons. It is produced and secreted by Bacillus subtilis during fermentation. Unlike most therapeutic enzymes \u2014 which remain trapped inside bacterial cells and are difficult to extract \u2014 nattokinase accumulates directly in the fermented food itself, making it unusually accessible.</p> <p>A standard 50-gram serving of natto contains roughly 500 mg of nattokinase, equivalent to about 1,500\u20132,000 Fibrinolytic Units (FU) \u2014 the standardized measure of its activity.</p>","tags":["natto","bacillus subtilis","nattokinase","history of natto"]},{"location":"en/natto-history/#how-it-works-molecular-scissors-a-cleanup-crew-and-a-released-brake","title":"How it works: molecular scissors, a cleanup crew, and a released brake","text":"<p>To understand why nattokinase has sparked such scientific interest, it helps to understand how a thrombus \u2014 the internal clot that can cause a heart attack or stroke \u2014 forms in the first place.</p> <p>When a blood vessel is damaged, the body activates a brilliant emergency response. Platelets cluster at the injury site, and the protein fibrin weaves a three-dimensional net that traps red blood cells, solidifying the plug. It is like pouring fast-setting cement into a crack. For wounds, this is lifesaving.</p> <p>The problem arises when this process activates in the wrong place \u2014 inside a coronary or cerebral artery \u2014 or when clots fail to dissolve quickly enough.</p> <p>The body has its own solvent: plasmin, which breaks down fibrin. But plasmin exists in its active form only briefly. Its inactive precursor, plasminogen, requires a signal \u2014 tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) \u2014 to convert. With aging and cardiovascular risk factors, this system can become saturated or inhibited.</p> <p>Nattokinase acts through three simultaneous pathways, which is precisely what makes it exceptional:</p> <p>First: It works directly as molecular scissors on fibrin, cleaving the peptide bonds at lysine and arginine residues that hold the clot\u2019s network together. No prior signal required. It simply cuts.</p> <p>Second: It activates the host\u2019s plasminogen, amplifying the body\u2019s own cleanup system \u2014 as if calling in reinforcements from the local army.</p> <p>Third \u2014 and perhaps most sophisticated: It inactivates PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), the molecule that suppresses the natural fibrinolytic system. Elevated PAI-1 levels, common in people with cardiovascular risk factors, effectively apply a brake to the body\u2019s ability to clear clots. Nattokinase releases that brake.</p> <p>The combined result: it not only dissolves existing clots but also helps prevent new ones by reducing circulating levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII \u2014 key players in the coagulation cascade.</p>","tags":["natto","bacillus subtilis","nattokinase","history of natto"]},{"location":"en/natto-history/#from-the-petri-dish-to-clinical-trials","title":"From the Petri dish to clinical trials","text":"<p>For any promising molecule, the real question is not does it work in a test tube? but does it work in people? Here, the data are both compelling and responsibly nuanced.</p> <p>Animal models: In rats, nattokinase restored 62% of blood flow in arteries with experimentally induced clots, compared to 15.8% in controls. In dogs with artificial clots, an oral 1,000 mg dose produced complete reperfusion in under five hours; placebo produced none.</p> <p>First human trial (1990): Sumi administered natto to 12 healthy volunteers. In every participant, plasma fibrinolytic activity increased significantly. This provided the first evidence that the enzyme survives digestion and reaches the bloodstream intact \u2014 a finding definitively confirmed in 2015 using modern techniques.</p> <p>The plaque study (2022): A clinical trial of 1,062 participants in China (average age 67.5) evaluated nattokinase\u2019s effect on carotid atherosclerotic plaques.

A critical nuance: 3,600 FU per day produced no significant effect, underscoring the importance of dosage.</p> <p>2023 meta-analysis: Reviewing six randomized controlled trials (546 participants), researchers confirmed that nattokinase reduces systolic blood pressure by an average of 3.45 mmHg and diastolic by 2.32 mmHg \u2014 modest but statistically robust effects.

Decades later, in 1872, the botanist and microbiologist Ferdinand Julius Cohn reclassified it as Bacillus subtilis \u2014 the \u201csubtle rod\u201d \u2014 the name it still bears today. No one could have imagined that seventy years later, this humble soil microorganism would become the unlikely protagonist of one of the most curious episodes in wartime medicine.</p> <p>The setting was Libya, 1941. General Erwin Rommel\u2019s Afrika Korps was advancing with tactical precision across North Africa, but inside the camps a far deadlier enemy carried no weapons: Shigella, the bacterium responsible for bacillary dysentery. Hundreds of soldiers were falling ill each week, weakened by severe diarrhea, fever, and dehydration. Antibiotics were not yet widely available \u2014 penicillin was only beginning to be produced experimentally \u2014 and the sulfonamides on hand were used primarily for topical applications. The German army\u2019s medical corps found itself, as contemporary accounts put it, \u201cwithout pharmaceutical ammunition.\u201d</p> <p>According to the most widely cited version of the story \u2014 reconstructed from an article by Dr. J\u00f6rg Bernhardt of the Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald \u2014 physicians in the Afrika Korps noticed something puzzling: local Bedouins also contracted dysentery, yet they recovered with a consistency the German troops could not match.</p> <p>Closer observation revealed the reason. At the first sign of symptoms, the Bedouins would closely follow a camel or horse until it defecated \u2014 and then ingest the dung while it was still warm. The only empirical rule passed down through generations was simple: the remedy did not work once the dung had cooled.</p> <p>Medical officers and bacteriologists dispatched to investigate analyzed fresh animal feces and found it rich in Bacillus subtilis \u2014 a spore-forming bacterium resistant to heat and known for its ability to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms, including species of Shigella. Based on this finding, the German army began producing concentrated cultures of B. subtilis for its troops. Dysentery ceased to be the silent threat it once was.</p> <p>But the story does not end there \u2014 it carries an uncomfortable scientific epilogue.</p> <p>In 2022, a team of researchers published a rigorous analysis in PLOS ONE examining the historical account. After an extensive literature review, they found that every reference to the camel dung episode ultimately traced back to a single source \u2014 Bernhardt\u2019s article \u2014 with no independent corroborating evidence. </p> <p>More strikingly, when researchers analyzed fecal samples from Egyptian dromedaries using 16S sequencing and ethanol-resistant culture techniques, they detected B. subtilis spores in quantities comparable to those found in human feces and soil \u2014 several orders of magnitude below the documented minimum therapeutic dose (10\u2079 spores per day). The conclusion was direct: the amount of B. subtilis present in camel dung is, in all likelihood, insufficient to explain a clinical improvement through that route.</p> <p>What is historically well established is that, beginning in 1946, B. subtilis cultures were commercialized in Europe and the Americas under brand names such as Bacti-Subtil. They were used as immunostimulants in the treatment of gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections. Today, their mechanism of action is linked, among other effects, to the production of subtilosin \u2014 a broad-spectrum antibiotic \u2014 and to stimulation of humoral immunity through the secretion of IgM, IgG, and IgA.</p> <p>The rise of synthetic antibiotics in the 1950s pushed these preparations to the margins of pharmacology. Yet interest in B. subtilis as a probiotic has never disappeared. In 2023, the German Association for General and Applied Microbiology named it \u201cMicrobe of the Year.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the camel dung story is true or apocryphal, it illustrates something microbiologists understand well: traditional empirical knowledge can point in the right direction long before formal science finds the language to explain it. That the explanation later proves more complex than expected is not a failure \u2014 it is simply how science works.</p>"},{"location":"en/natto-wwii/#discover-more","title":"Discover more:","text":"<ul> <li>Natto: the primary dietary source of vitamin K2</li> <li>The history of natto</li> <li>Natto against the spike protein</li> </ul>"},{"location":"es/","title":"Natto: fuente principal de vitamina K2, soluci\u00f3n a la paradoja del calcio","text":"","tags":["natto","bacilus subtilis","comida japonesa","nattokinasa","salud \u00f3sea","vitamina-k2"]},{"location":"es/#que-es-la-paradoja-del-calcio-y-por-que-es-tan-importante","title":"\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la paradoja del calcio y por qu\u00e9 es tan importante?","text":"<p>La vitamina K2 es crucial debido a un fen\u00f3meno llamado la \u201cParadoja del Calcio\u201d: personas que tienen exceso de calcio en las arterias (riesgo de infarto) pero, al mismo tiempo, falta de calcio en los huesos (osteoporosis).</p> <p>La vitamina K2 resuelve este problema:</p> <ol> <li>Saca el calcio de donde estorba: Evita que las arterias se vuelvan r\u00edgidas como \u201ctuber\u00edas de piedra\u201d.  </li> <li>Lo pone donde falta: Construye un esqueleto s\u00f3lido.</li> </ol> <p>La vitamina K2 (menaquinona) es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de obtener en una dieta vegetariana que la K1, dado que se produce principalmente mediante la fermentaci\u00f3n bacteriana.</p> <p>Mientras que la K1 abunda en vegetales de hoja verde, la vitamina K2 se encuentra de forma natural  en alimentos fermentados y algunos productos de origen animal, como los l\u00e1cteos y los huevos.</p>","tags":["natto","bacilus subtilis","comida japonesa","nattokinasa","salud \u00f3sea","vitamina-k2"]},{"location":"es/#fuentes-de-vitamina-k2","title":"Fuentes de Vitamina K2","text":"Alimento Categor\u00eda Contenido Aproximado (\u00b5g/100g) Forma Principal Natto Vegetal (Fermentado) 850 \u2013 1100 MK-7 Pate de H\u00edgado de Ganso \u00d3rgano Animal 369 MK-4 H\u00edgado de Pollo \u00d3rgano Animal 13 \u2013 150* MK-4 H\u00edgado de Vaca \u00d3rgano Animal 11 \u2013 106* MK-4 Quesos Curados (M\u00fcnster, Gouda, etc) L\u00e1cteo 50 \u2013 80 MK-8, MK-9 Anguila Pescado 63 MK-4 Quesos Blandos (Brie, Camembert) L\u00e1cteo 35 \u2013 60 MK-8, MK-9 Yema de Huevo (Pastoreo) Huevo 15 \u2013 32 MK-4 Mantequilla Grasa L\u00e1ctea 15 MK-4 Miso / Tempeh Vegetal (Fermentado) 10 \u2013 30 MK-7 Chucrut / Kimchi Vegetal (Fermentado) 2 \u2013 5 MK-7 <ul> <li>El Natto es el \u201cRey\u201d: Es, por mucho, la fuente m\u00e1s rica de K2 en el mundo.

D\u00e9cadas despu\u00e9s, en 1872, el bot\u00e1nico y microbi\u00f3logo Ferdinand Julius Cohn la rebautiz\u00f3 como Bacillus subtilis \u2014 el \u201cbast\u00f3n sutil\u201d \u2014 nombre que conserva hasta hoy. Nadie imaginaba entonces que, setenta a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, ese microorganismo del suelo acabar\u00eda protagonizando uno de los episodios m\u00e1s curiosos de la medicina de guerra.</p> <p>El escenario fue Libia, en 1941. Las tropas del Afrika Korps del general Erwin Rommel avanzaban con eficacia t\u00e1ctica por el norte de \u00c1frica, pero en los campamentos el enemigo m\u00e1s letal no usaba armas: era Shigella, la bacteria responsable de la disenter\u00eda bacilar. Cientos de soldados ca\u00edan cada semana, debilitados por diarreas severas, fiebre y deshidrataci\u00f3n. Los antibi\u00f3ticos no exist\u00edan a\u00fan como recurso cl\u00ednico generalizado \u2014 la penicilina apenas comenzaba a producirse de manera experimental \u2014 y los sulfam\u00eddicos disponibles eran de uso t\u00f3pico.

La observaci\u00f3n detenida revel\u00f3 la raz\u00f3n: al aparecer los primeros s\u00edntomas, los beduinos segu\u00edan de cerca a un camello o un caballo hasta que el animal defecaba, y entonces inger\u00edan el esti\u00e9rcol todav\u00eda caliente. La \u00fanica regla emp\u00edrica que transmit\u00edan de generaci\u00f3n en generaci\u00f3n era que el remedio no funcionaba si el esti\u00e9rcol se hab\u00eda enfriado.</p> <p>Los m\u00e9dicos y bacteri\u00f3logos enviados al terreno analizaron las heces frescas de los animales y encontraron en ellas una abundante presencia de Bacillus subtilis, bacteria formadora de esporas resistentes al calor y con una notable capacidad para inhibir el crecimiento de microorganismos pat\u00f3genos \u2014 incluidas las bacterias del g\u00e9nero Shigella.

En 2022, un equipo de investigadores public\u00f3 en PLOS ONE un an\u00e1lisis riguroso del relato, con resultados que merecen atenci\u00f3n. Tras una extensa revisi\u00f3n bibliogr\u00e1fica, encontraron que todas las referencias a la historia del esti\u00e9rcol de camello se remontan a una \u00fanica fuente \u2014 precisamente el art\u00edculo de Bernhardt \u2014 sin evidencia independiente que la corrobore. M\u00e1s a\u00fan, al analizar heces de dromedarios egipcios mediante secuenciaci\u00f3n 16S y cultivos resistentes a etanol, detectaron cantidades de esporas de B. subtilis comparables a las presentes en heces humanas y en el suelo: varias \u00f3rdenes de magnitud por debajo de la dosis terap\u00e9utica m\u00ednima documentada (10\u2079 esporas por d\u00eda). La conclusi\u00f3n fue directa: la cantidad de B. subtilis en las heces de camello resulta, muy probablemente, insuficiente para explicar una mejora cl\u00ednica por esa v\u00eda.</p> <p>Lo que s\u00ed es hist\u00f3ricamente firme es que, a partir de 1946, cultivos de B. subtilis se comercializaron en Europa y Am\u00e9rica bajo marcas como Bacti-Subtil, utilizados como inmunoestimuladores en el tratamiento de infecciones gastrointestinales y del tracto urinario. Su mecanismo de acci\u00f3n hoy se vincula, entre otros efectos, a la producci\u00f3n de subtilusina \u2014 un antibi\u00f3tico de amplio espectro \u2014 y a la estimulaci\u00f3n de la inmunidad humoral mediante la secreci\u00f3n de IgM, IgG e IgA.
